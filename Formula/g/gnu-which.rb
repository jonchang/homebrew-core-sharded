  def caveats; <<~EOS
    GNU "which" has been installed as "gwhich".
    If you need to use it as "which", you can add a "gnubin" directory
    to your PATH from your bashrc like:

        PATH="#{opt_libexec}/gnubin:$PATH"

    Additionally, you can access its man page with normal name if you add
    the "gnuman" directory to your MANPATH from your bashrc as well:

        MANPATH="#{opt_libexec}/gnuman:$MANPATH"
  EOS
  end

  test do
    system "#{bin}/gwhich", "gcc"
    system "#{opt_libexec}/gnubin/which", "gcc"
  end
end
