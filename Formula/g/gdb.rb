  def message; <<-EOS.undent
    A build of GDB using a brewed Python was requested, but Python is not
    a universal build.

    GDB requires Python to be built as a universal binary or it will fail
    if attempting to debug a 32-bit binary on a 64-bit host.

    gdb requires special privileges to access Mach ports.
    You will need to codesign the binary. For instructions, see:
