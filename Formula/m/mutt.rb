# Note: Mutt has a large number of non-upstream patches available for
# it, some of which conflict with each other. These patches are also
# not kept up-to-date when new versions of mutt (occasionally) come
# out.
#
# To reduce Homebrew's maintenance burden, new patches are not being
# accepted for this formula. We would be very happy to see members of
# the mutt community maintain a more comprehesive tap with better
# support for patches.
